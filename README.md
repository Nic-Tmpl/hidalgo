An E-commerce site with strange product choices....
This was built as part of the CodeCademy Full-Stack Engineer course, combining my 'Generic E-commerce API' with a frontend, utilizing a PERN stack.

 ### Features
1. Products can be viewed in entirety or by category, and have a separate product details page. 
2. User signup/account management/login authentication.
3. Admin users have a separate page to add/edit/delete products from the store.
4. A checkout experience (mockup does not store payment/address info).
5. Users can view prior order history and individual order details.

## Tech Stack
### Backend
+ [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)/[Express](https://expressjs.com/) for backend.
+ [Express-Promise-Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-promise-router) for modern Async/Await calls in express routes.
+ [Express-Session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session)/[Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/)/[bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) for user authentication.
+ [PostGreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for database.
+ [node postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) to connect database to backend.
+ [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) for environment variables.

### Frontend
+ [React](https://reactjs.org) is used for UI.
+ [Reduxjs/toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) is used for state management across the app.
+ [react-router-V6](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for easy navigation and linking from screen to screen.
+ [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) to create easy Async/Await calls between client and server.

### Upcoming Revisions
Currently this app is still under construction. There are some bugs and edge-cases I haven't gotten around to fixing yet, but its intended purpose is to demonstrate the functionality of the Generic E-commerce API.
